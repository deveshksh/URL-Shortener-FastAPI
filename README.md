# URL Shortener Project

## Overview

The URL Shortener project is a web application built using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL. The application provides a simple interface for users to enter a long URL, which is then shortened and stored in a database. Users can access the shortened URL to be redirected to the original long URL.

The project also includes a basic frontend, allowing users to interact with the URL shortener service via a web form.

## Features

- **Shorten Long URLs:** Users can input a long URL and receive a shortened version.
- **Redirection:** Accessing the shortened URL redirects the user to the original long URL.
- **Basic Frontend:** A simple web interface allows users to easily interact with the service.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- Git (optional, for version control)

You will also need to install the required Python packages and set up a PostgreSQL database.
